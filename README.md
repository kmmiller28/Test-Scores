##Task

This program allows the user to enter as many test scores as they need and then produces the total as well as average between all the scores entered. 

##Summary

This program was built using c++ and I chose to use Visual Studio to accomplish this task due to its powerful developer tooling.

##Functionality

In the program, the user is asked to enter how many test scores they will be adding. An array is created to hold the number of scores and then a for loop is initialized to step through each test score. Another for loop is created to count the total number of test scores which then is used to figure out the average between them. The program then displays the results of the total and averages between scores entered. 

C++, Visual Studio
